# fetch take home project

This is a take home project I was sent by the company fetch!
All you have to do after cloning and downloading is enter a Name and Email (it doesn't check for valid email composition)
and you can start searching and filtering different dogs by breed, age, and name!
After you search for results, you can click the little heart icon to favorite any dogs you want to match with.
A favorites bar will then appear at the top of the page, and from there you can choose to match with whatever dogs you've
favorited, or remove them from the favorites list.

Once you click "Match" You'll be paired with a random favorite from your list and will see the confetti for your favorite!
